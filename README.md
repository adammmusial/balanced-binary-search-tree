# Binary Search Tree Implementation

## About the Project
I implemented a binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript to get a hands-on understanding of tree data structures. The `Tree` class includes methods for building the tree from an array, inserting and deleting nodes, and traversing the tree in various orders (inorder, preorder, postorder, and level order). It can also check if the tree is balanced, rebalance it, and calculate the height and depth of nodes. Additionally, I created a `Node` class to represent individual nodes. This project helped me understand key concepts in data structures and algorithms.

Balanced binary search trees implemented with JavaScript

## Features

- `buildTree(array)` takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed
- `insert(value)` adds a new node containing the given value
- `delete(value)` deletes the node containing the given value
- `find(value)` returns the node with the given value
- `levelOrder()` traverses the tree in breadth-first level order
- `inorder()` traverses the tree in inorder depth-first order
- `preorder()` traverses the tree in preorder depth-first order
- `postorder()` traverses the tree in postorder depth-first order
- `height(node)` returns the height of the given node
- `depth(node)` returns the depth of the given node
- `isBalanced()` checks if the tree is balanced
- `rebalance()` rebalances an unbalanced tree

## Key learnings:
- Constructing a binary search tree from a sorted array
- Implementing tree traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder, and level order)
- Inserting and deleting nodes in a binary search tree
- Checking and rebalancing a binary search tree
- Calculating the height and depth of tree nodes
