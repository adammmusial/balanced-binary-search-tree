# Binary Search Tree Implementation

## About the Project
I implemented a binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript to get a hands-on understanding of tree data structures. The `Tree` class includes methods for building the tree from an array, inserting and deleting nodes, and traversing the tree in various orders (inorder, preorder, postorder, and level order). It can also check if the tree is balanced, rebalance it, and calculate the height and depth of nodes. Additionally, I created a `Node` class to represent individual nodes. This project helped me understand key concepts in data structures and algorithms.

## Key learnings:
- Constructing a binary search tree from a sorted array
- Implementing tree traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder, and level order)
- Inserting and deleting nodes in a binary search tree
- Checking and rebalancing a binary search tree
- Calculating the height and depth of tree nodes
